# Current Status of SCExAO and VAMPIRES polarization
 
 I see a lot of citing the "Joost Hart" paper, but I also found the paper by Holstein to SPIE of the calibration of instrumental polarization for SCExAO-CHARIS

 Measurements that would be amazing
 - Calibration source before AO188
 - Linear polarized measurements in front of the FLC
 

 # Joost Hart Paper 
 *Full Characterization of the instrumental polarization effects of the spectropolarimetric mode of SCEXAO-CHARIS*
 - CHARIS works in NIR (JHK)
 - Spectropolarimetric mode is an IFU + a walloston prism
 - The image derotator is strongly polarizing, convering 95% of incident linear polarization into circular polarization
 - Need to characterize polarization and crosstalk
